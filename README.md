## TODO

* Currently the application assumes you're traveling to Japan. (Because why wouldn't you.) I want to add the option to set a different country, and update all the components thereafter.

* I want to improve the styling generally. And the way you navigate to the options-section. Now it's an anchorlink connected to the options-id, but also set to toggle the visibility of this section – so depending on if it's already toggled or not – you wont be sent there, or see it.
