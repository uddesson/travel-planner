# Travel Planner Light

A simple travel planner-dashboard created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## TODO

* Currently the application assumes you're traveling to Japan. (Because why wouldn't you.) I want to add the option to set a different country, and update all the components thereafter.

## Resources

* [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)
* Foreign exchange rates and currency conversion [JSON API Fixer IO](https://fixer.io/)
